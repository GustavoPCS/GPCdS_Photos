            <h1>wHo iN THe hELL mADe tHis WeBSiTe<em>?</em></h1>
            <p>Hey there. Welcome to my photography portfolio. I’m Gustavo—artist, photographer, and probably a human being. 
            Or at least mostly human.
            If you find yourself wondering whether this entire “About Me” section sounds suspiciously well-written, 
            you’re absolutely right: there’s a 60/40 chance 
             ChatGPT might’ve had a hand in crafting this. Or a robotic claw, if you prefer that metaphor.
            </p>

            <p class="right-align">I shoot photos for a living because the idea of a “traditional 9-to-5” made me break into a cold sweat. 
                My specialty lies in making fleeting moments feel like they hold infinite meaning. 
                Some would call that pretentious, I call it vibes. You know the vibes.
                The ones that make you stare at a photo of a foggy forest and suddenly question your life choices while also appreciating the geometry of light.
            </p>

            <p>My style blends equal parts poetic nostalgia, spontaneous randomness, and a touch of “did an AI generate this 
                for me?” vibes—because
                even my artistic process is deeply self-aware and slightly digital. My camera and I have had countless arguments
                 about artistic intent, aesthetics,
                  and whether I should just let a neural network finish this artist statement instead. Spoiler alert: I let the neural network win.
            </p>

            <p class="right-align">
                So, if you’re here because you value genuine artistry, cool lighting, or you have a taste for what might 
                be considered “postmodern visual irony” (thanks, ChatGPT),
                you’re in the right place. Browse my work, pick your favorite photo, and let it haunt you. Maybe you’ll feel something deep and inexplicable about it. Maybe you’ll just think, “Wow, good lighting.” Either way, mission accomplished.

            </p>

            <p>
                <br>
                With love,
                <br>
